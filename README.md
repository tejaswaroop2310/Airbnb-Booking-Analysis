# Airbnb Booking Analysis

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to  explore and analyze the Airbnb data to discover key understanding such as :
* What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
* What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
* Which hosts are the busiest and why?
* Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it? 


### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Explorative Data Analysis


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## Project Description
Our experiment can help understand the data and providing the insights by Explorative data analysis and data wrangling

__Data preparation__ : In this step, we define the sources of data, define data schemas and tables, understand the main characteristics of the data, clean the dataset, delete non-relevant datasets, transform the data, and divide the data into required chunks for analysis.<br> <br>
__Data analysis__ :  The main tasks involve summarizing the data, finding the hidden correlation and relationships among the data. Some of the techniques used for data summarization are summary tables, graphs, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, correlation statistics.<br> <br>
__Data Visualizations__ : This is  an essential step as the result analysed from the dataset should be interpretable by the business stakeholders, which is one of the major goals of EDA. Most of the graphical analysis techniques include scattering plots, character plots, histograms, box plots, residual plots, mean plots, and others. We will explore several types of graphical representations
##Conclusion:
- As Staten Island is an island the availability of rooms is less compared to other places
- The Room prices are high in Manhattan, I think there is a lot of demand for these rooms
-As Home/apartments are more facilities, they are having more prices compared to other types of rooms
- of the rooms are having zero days of availability and there are only a few rooms with 365 days of availability
- the entire home room types are high in number whereas when it comes to private room types, we can Brooklyn is in the lead.
