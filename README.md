Data Visualizations: This is  an essential step as the result analysed from the dataset should be interpretable by the business stakeholders, which is one of the major goals of EDA. Most of the graphical analysis techniques include scattering plots, character plots, histograms, box plots, residual plots, mean plots, and others. We will explore several types of graphical representations
